                    web development with python and the beautiful Django framework. It's not like my hands are 24/7 on
                    the keyboard, Hanging out with friends and playing sports is also my thing.</p>

                    people from different places with a different vibes upheld my overall growth. St Maryâ€™s College was
                    a perfect place for me to spend my campus life. The academic life I had there have helped me to
                    chose a passionate career path and more importantly finding some cool people to have around me. </p>
